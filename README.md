## multipass - A Parallel Installable Packages Demo

This project demonstrates how to support multiple versions of packages on
the same system.  You can pin different programs to specific runtimes, show
which packages have multiple versions available on the system, and so on.

This demo is suitable for recent versions of Fedora, CentOS 7, or RHEL 7
systems.  Initial development and testing was done on Fedora 27 x86_64.

Follow the steps in the INSTALL file to get the demo running and to
experiment with it.
